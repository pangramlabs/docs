## Installation

```bash
pip install pangram-sdk
```

## API Key Setup

You can provide your API key in two ways.

**Option 1: Environment variable**

```bash
export PANGRAM_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

**Option 2: Pass directly to the constructor**

```python
from pangram import Pangram

pangram_client = Pangram(api_key="your-api-key")
```

## AI Detection

### Main prediction

Returns detailed analysis with AI-assistance detection and segment-level metrics.

```python
from pangram import Pangram

pangram_client = Pangram()
result = pangram_client.predict(text)

# V3 analysis with AI-assistance detection
fraction_ai = result['fraction_ai']
fraction_ai_assisted = result['fraction_ai_assisted']
fraction_human = result['fraction_human']
num_ai_segments = result['num_ai_segments']

# Access individual window classifications
for window in result['windows']:
    label = window['label']
    ai_assistance_score = window['ai_assistance_score']
    confidence = window['confidence']
```

### Short prediction

Single Pangram model prediction, cuts off text at 512 tokens.

```python
from pangram import Pangram

pangram_client = Pangram()
result = pangram_client.predict_short(text)

# Score in range [0, 1] where 0 is human-written and 1 is AI-generated
score = result['ai_likelihood']
```

## Plagiarism Detection

The plagiarism detection API checks text against a vast database of online content:

```python
from pangram import Pangram

pangram_client = Pangram()

text = "Text to check for plagiarism"
result = pangram_client.check_plagiarism(text)

if result['plagiarism_detected']:
    print(f"Plagiarism detected! {result['percent_plagiarized']}% of the text may be plagiarized.")
    for content in result['plagiarized_content']:
        print(f"Found match at {content['source_url']}")
        print(f"Matched text: {content['matched_text']}")
```

The response includes:

- Whether plagiarism was detected
- List of plagiarized content with source URLs
- Total number of sentences checked
- List of plagiarized sentences
- Percentage of text that was plagiarized
